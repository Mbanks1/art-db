# ART DB

Art DB is a dynamic art database that allows you to create, add, update and delete art works of your own or within the Art database. 
You may keep track of these works in your personal profile collection, where you can find out where art work is located, how much the piece is worth and other important details about the art work. 
Eventually, ArtDB will be broken into 2 major parts. A fantasy collection to map out future pieces you'd like to acquire. And a personal collection that entails works that a user owns. This will help a user to value their collection, know its conditions for insurance purposes as well as know exactly where their piece of art is being stored be it in a storage facility in a home or being borrowed by an idividual, museum, gallery or auction house.
