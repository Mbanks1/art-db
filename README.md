# ART DB

Art DB is an art database that allows you to store your art works descriptions and location. 

You may keep track of these works in your personal 'Profile Collection', where you can find out important details about the art work.


Eventually, ArtDB will be broken into 2 major parts. A fantasy collection to map out future pieces you'd like to acquire - and a personal collection that entails works that a user already owns. This will help a user to value their collection, know its conditions for insurance purposes as well as know exactly where their piece of art is being stored whether that be in a storage facility, living in a home or being showed by an idividual, museum, gallery or auction house.
